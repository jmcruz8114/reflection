When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When colaborating with others, working from a different computer, or just need some practice

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It helps to cut down on the amount of pushes and pulls needed, especially when you are working on something that you later decide not to keep.  Also, alot of times you don't want something public until it works, which might be a few more commits down the road.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are copies of repositories, the same as clones except it has a connection via github with the original, and branches are commits aren't or haven't been introduced back into the master line for any number of reasons.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
